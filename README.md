My safety-focused little app would be called "I Am Home." One texts a buddy or anybody they want to share the monitoring software with when they reach home. If their phone is stolen, there is an emergency, or for any other reason, this will notify the person that you will send them a live picture or video of themselves at home. The alert will continue to sound until someone messages confirmation of their residenceâ€”a picture or a video. Should they fail to provide evidence of their presence at home, the user's designated emergency contact will get an automated phone call or text message. Those who feel unsafe at home need to take this action right now. This is something I would like to create as a project app. On this app, friends and relatives should be allowed to communicate only, and when the user is alone, get from point A to point B. For those who are inebriated, disabled, have illnesses, are teenagers, or have private matters to be kept private, this could be useful. Between the two people. If the user at issue isn't responding, anyone on the user's contact list can call and message this app countless times. The user of this app cannot turn off any emergency alarm. Up until instructions are carried through, it is activated.
